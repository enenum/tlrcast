      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=FJRxzlDgcHk</link>
      <description>Here is an important teaching that reveals how far the churches have come away from the call Jesus gave us.&#xA;The Bible makes it clear that Jesus paid the price not only so that we can be forgiven of our sins, but also so that people can be healed. Therefore, he called his disciples to both preach the gospel and heal the sick. We who are disciples of Jesus today should therefore also do the same.

      <description>www.TheLastReformation.com&#xA;The Holy Spirit was an important part of the early church. It was Him who told them what they should do. It was Him who led them. With Him they experienced the power of God in their lives.&#xA;You will love this lesson where Torben tells many powerful testimonies about how we today can be led by the Holy Spirit. He also gives practical advice on how you can live the life we read about in the book of Acts.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[www.TheLastReformation.com
The Holy Spirit was an important part of the early church. It was Him who told them what they should do. It was Him who led them. With Him they experienced the power of God in their lives.
You will love this lesson where Torben tells many powerful testimonies about how we today can be led by the Holy Spirit. He also gives practical advice on how you can live the life we read about in the book of Acts. A life led by the Holy Spirit. - http://www.TheLastReformation.com

      <title>Lesson 25 - Family or orphanage - The Pioneer School Extra</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=SgpOAhwkhqg</link>
      <description>Now it is time, time to set up new fellowships on a new foundation. We still believe that we need to see a reformation of the church that is already there, but at the same time we feel that now it is time to set up completely new fellowships with new people on a good new foundation. This is the first lesson out of a series, where Torben will speak about church and will help to give a clear picture of how a New Testament church can look like. In this lesson &#34;Family or orphanage&#34; you will see the difference between a family (New Testament church) and an orphanage (the religious institution) and that not one model works for every family.&#xA;We hope that this teaching will bless you, challenge you, and create a desire in you to see the church as Jesus wants it to be.&#xA;&#xA;Help us caption &amp; translate this video!&#xA;&#xA;https://amara.org/v/gGNF/</description>

We need to understand that God is calling us to grow people and not just gather people. 
TO grow them up from babies to children to fathers in the faith..

This is an important lesson about the different stages people go through in their walk with God. 
If we want to be effective in making disciples and building fellowships based on the New Testament we need to know this. 
If you give a beef to a baby it will die.
If you give milk to a young man he will maybe live for some time, but he will not grow and he will also end up dead. 

The same way we need to know the truth about the spiritual growth I am sharing in this lesson 26 on the online Pioneer school. 
See it and let God show you where you are and how you can make disciples effective and build fellowships.

      <title>Lesson 27 - Apostolic teams: Winning homes and cities for Jesus - The Pioneer School Extra</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=57zNU6oZt6U</link>
      <description>We are really excited about this lesson where we are talking about the 5-fold ministry Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd and Teacher. We believe this is important to understand if we want to build new testament fellowships &#xA;I got a strong prophecy many years ago about working in apostolic teams and we will see great things. I really had a longing to see this happening, but I never saw it working in the churches I knew. We didn’t understand it the right way, because we read it like it was a position and not a function. We used the teaching to put people in a box and not to set people free, but now we are starting to see it the right way. I am really excited about this lesson.&#xA;Hope you will see this.&#xA;Everyone needs to hear this.&#xA;&#xA;Here is the other video i talked about:&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LIh4Z2CNak&#xA;&#xA;Help us caption &amp; translate this video!&#xA;&#xA;https://amara.org/v/mAg9/</description>

      <description>In this lesson we put a lot of what we have learnt together and we look at the importance of communion. Just like baptism in water, communion is not only a symbol but it&#39;s so much more then what people think it is.&#xA;&#xA;We also give you a simple &#34;model&#34; of what you can do when you gather with small groups to disciple each other. &#xA;&#xA;See the online Pioneer school here:&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0gVAb8r3Mj-GbT18XWdro0Kt_6wM0kv_&#xA;&#xA;Help us caption &amp; translate this video!&#xA;&#xA;https://amara.org/v/mM2k/&#xA;&#xA;Help us caption &amp; translate this video!&#xA;&#xA;https://amara.org/v/mWnw/</description>
